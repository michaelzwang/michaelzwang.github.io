<!-- 
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was fun to wireframe and work on the blog template with a pair. It was cool to bounce ideas off one another.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
It was a little helpful in order to visualize the final process, but kind of difficult to imagine the formatting without the knowledge of CSS.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
A good wireframe is specific in making a skeletal framework for the site. It doesn't include the exact details for each page though.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
N/A
