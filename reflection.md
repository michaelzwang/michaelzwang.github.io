###What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

Padding is the space between text and the border, and margin is the space outside the border. I learned how important padding and margins are for creating the look that I desired for my site. It took me some trial and error to understand how to manipulate the padding and margins.

###What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that positioning depends on the padding and margins as well as the size of the block you are manipulating. 

###What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest to implement was the font, color, and link design. The most difficult was definitely the formatting and positioning with padding and margins. 

###What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that it is a lot of trial and error so it helps to work on it while also checking my progress. Although, it was challenging, it was really fun to see the stylistic changes being made and see the website take form based on my own decisions.
