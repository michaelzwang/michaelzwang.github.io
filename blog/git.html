        As the year draws to a close, I am excited to start this new journey into the world of computer programing. This week I began by learning how to use the command line, Git and GitHub.

        The main takeway from this week was learning the difference between Git & GitHub. The two terms had always been confusing to me, so I was glad that I had the time to finally distinguish them from each other. It turns out that Git is softwarre that you install on your computer that provides a history of content changes. This ability to keep track of all changes made to a file and the option to revert back to a previous version of the file is called version control. Version control is useful because it allows the user to go back to a save point to revise code in case of bugs. Additionally, it facilitates collaborative changes to a file by allowing multiple users to work on their own copy before merging the changes.

        GitHub is a cool invention where you can store and access your work online. It allows you to host and share your code with others, and allows others to offer feedback and suggestions to your code. GitHub is a great collaboration tool that works in sync with Git.

        The thing that surprised me the most was that I can use the command line to directly upload my work online to GitHub. For me, this was a new concept that I had to wrap my head around. Overall, I found it really fun to be able to create new files and directories and send them over to my repositories on GitHub.
