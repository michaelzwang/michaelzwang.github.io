  <h2>Diversity in Tech</h2>
  <h4>January 22, 2016</h4>

  <section>
    <p>One major problem the tech industry faces today is the lack of diversity in its workforce. It is clear from looking at employment data from tech companies, that the workforce is predominately white, Asian, and male.</p>
    <p>Although we live in a society that prides itself on equality and equal opportunity, the gender and minority gap in representation can be seen all over the country, not just in the tech industry. Right now, the Academy Awards have come under fire for only nominating white actors for the major Oscar categories.</p>
    <p>I think one of the main challenges for women and minorities, especially in tech, is having the same opportunities, starting from childhood. By encouraging and stimulating interest from a young age, more women and minorities can find it possible to strive for a career in tech.</p>
    <p>Another main factor for the lack of diversity in tech is the cultural stigma attached to women and minorities. There is still a sort of "white male privilege" that exists today despite the growing number of educated women and minorities. </p>
    <p>Ultimately, I believe that this cultural stigma is mostly generational and can be changed over time. I think new generations will be able to be more accepting of people from different and diverse backgrounds. This all starts with exposure at a young age and viewing it as the norm. Of course, nothing will change unless we instigate a change. By actively recognizing and solving the problem of the lack of diversity, I hope that the tech industry can be a leader in representation and inspire future generations to go into the field. </p>
