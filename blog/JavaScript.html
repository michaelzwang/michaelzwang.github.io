  <h2>Ruby Hashes vs JavaScript Objects</h2>
  <h4>February 12, 2016</h4>

  <section>
    <p>After spending the past few weeks learning Ruby, it was strange to jump into JavaScript. I immediately noticed many similarities, but it was also hard to work through the differences. In this post I will compare and contrast Ruby hashes to JavaScript objects.</p>

    <p>In Ruby, hashes are a way to collect and store information organized in key/value pairs like so:</p>
    <pre>
      hash_name = { key1: value1, key2: value2 }
    </pre>
    <p>You can then access a key/value pair like this:</p>
    <pre>
      hash_name[:key1]          #=> value1
    </pre>

    <p>In JavaScript however, there is no built-in hash documentation. Rather, you can define an object literal which has similar functionality to a Ruby hash. Instead of a keys, JavaScript has variables called the object properties.</p>
    <pre>
      var new_object = { property1: value1, property2: value2 };
    </pre>
    <p>You can access the properties like this:</p>
    <pre>
      new_object.property1;     //=> value1
    </pre>

    <p>As you can see, Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects are very similar in appearance and functionality. They are both used to store a collection of data. However, unlike Ruby keys, JavaScript properties must be variables. Additionally, Ruby hashes have built-in methods that do not work in JavaScript.</p>

    <p>The biggest and most important difference in my opinion is that JavaScript objects can take a function as a value.</p>

    <pre>
      var person = { name: "Michael"};

      person.say_hi = function(){
        console.log("Hi, my name is " + person.name + "!")
      };

      person.say_hi()

      //=> "Hi, my name is Michael!"
    </pre>
    <p>In the example above, I created a <code>person</code> object with a <code>name</code> property of "Michael". I then create a new property <code>say_hi</code> that is a function. I can then call the function on the object!</p>
